1.	We thought that the sample blogs were helpful to help describe the scope of the project. Provide examples of styles to write in. The reading that we did not find helpful was how to build a static website using Jekyll for Github. We thought that the article presented too much information at one time and was difficult to follow. Anything to do with how to use Github is confusing. 

2.	Incident reports or any official document that we would have to submit. Research papers, market reports, and summaries. 

3.	Ability to use visuals effectively and interpret visuals. Write in a concise format that is easy to understand and follow. How to use numbers in text.  

4.	DO NOT WANT
