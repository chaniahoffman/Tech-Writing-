I consider myself very knowledgable in the areas of animal science. I use a lot of jargon in regards to cattle and hog production, and livestock evaluation. I use terms such as AI, sound, plain-made, and many reproductive terms. I discuss nutrition and breeding techniques that have very specific terminology that can be very confusing for those who are not familiar with livestock production practices.
My blog is going to be focused on combining commercial hog production practices with sustainable farming techniques, therefore I am going to be using a lot of terminology that is specific to livestock production. To enable the general public to understand and really grasp what I am going to discuss, I will need to provide simple explanations and definitions. 

I am very accustomed to the hog farm at school and can provide very detailed sxamples and practices that are used there. I can describe the conditions of the pigs, from weaning age to market weight, as well as the status of our sows and boars. I will describe our nutrition protocols and vaccination procedures. I also plan on discussing our breeding regiment and how we evaluate what boar stud we are going to use on each female. 
I am also experienced in the farrowing process due to my internship at a commercial swine facility this summer. I am familiar with treating common pig ailments and sow farrowing issues.
