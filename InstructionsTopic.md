# Instructions Topic 

The process that I would like to give instructions for the typical method of processing pigs. I am going to use my expertise from working at the school's hog farm and from my time working at Springer Family Foods. I will go over what medicines are administered, how to administer those vaccines, how to castrate and dock tails, as well as teat counts and ear notching.
