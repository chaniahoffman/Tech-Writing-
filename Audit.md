## What are my witing habits? 

My writng habits are awful. Very seldom do I have the motivation to sit down and work on anything. However, wehn I do find the motivation I run with it. I can get a lot done when I want to. I am a procratinator, therefore most of my writing is done when I feel pressured to get it done. I do my best work alone, and away from people, usually sitting in my room. I work best at odd times, so either firt thing in the morning or late at night. When I write, I work on big sections. Once I start thinking about what I nd to write about it is best if I do not stop. If I stop I get distracted and or I come up with a completely different idea and hav to start over. 

## One Improvement 

I could improve by spending more time reading over what I have written. Such as revising and editing.

## One Strength

One of my strengths is that once I start writing, I do not stop. I can also come up some different points of view.
